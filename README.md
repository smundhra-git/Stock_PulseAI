### PLAN :

### **🚀 AI-Powered Financial Market Analysis Development Plan**  

## **📌 Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing**
Technical Analsysis of a stock based on 9 factors assigning a score from -9 to 9.

---

### **2️⃣ Collect Macroeconomic Data**
🔹 **Goal:** Get macroeconomic indicators (GDP, inflation, interest rates) that affect stock prices.  
🔹 **Data Sources:**  
   - **FRED API** (Federal Reserve Economic Data)  
   - **World Bank API**  
   - **BLS API** (Bureau of Labor Statistics)  
   - **IMF API**  
🔹 **Tasks:**  
   -[ ] Fetch GDP, inflation, bond yields, employment, etc.  
   -[ ] Correlate macro indicators with stock price movements  
   -[ ] Use **Regression models** (Linear, Ridge, Lasso)  
   -[ ] Train AI models (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) to **predict market sentiment**  

---

### **3️⃣ Collect Sentiment Data**
🔹 **Goal:** Use **social media & news sentiment analysis** to influence predictions.  
🔹 **Data Sources:**  
   - Twitter API  
   - Reddit API  
   - NewsAPI  
   - SEC Filings (For company reports)  
🔹 **Tasks:**  
   -[ ] Use **NLP models** (BERT, RoBERTa) to extract sentiment  
   -[ ] Correlate sentiment scores with market trends  
   -[ ] Fine-tune sentiment models on **financial data**  
   -[ ] Generate **real-time reports & visualizations**  

---

## **📌 Step 2: AI Model Training & Predictions**
Once the data is ready, we will build different **machine learning and deep learning models**.

### **4️⃣ Stock Price Prediction Models**
-[ ] **Regression Models** (Linear, Ridge, Lasso)  
-[ ] **Time Series Models** (ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM)  
-[ ] **Neural Networks** (Transformer-based models for multi-timeframe forecasting)  

### **5️⃣ Macroeconomic Impact Models**
-[ ] **XGBoost Model** for GDP-inflation-stock correlation  
-[ ] **Reinforcement Learning (DQN, PPO)** for adaptive market modeling  

### **6️⃣ Sentiment Analysis & AI Reports**
-[ ] **Sentiment Classification Model** (Bullish, Neutral, Bearish)  
-[ ] **Event-Based Market Movement Analysis**  
-[ ] **AI-Generated PDF Report with Market Predictions**  

---

## **📌 Step 3: Backend Development (API Integration)**
Once models are working, we will **serve them through APIs**.

🔹 **Django Backend (REST API)**
   -[ ] API for Stock Data Fetching  
   -[ ] API for Macro Data Analysis  
   -[ ] API for Sentiment Insights  

🔹 **FastAPI Backend (AI Model Inference)**
   -[ ] API for Price Predictions (1-day, 1-month, 1-year)  
   -[ ] API for Economic Impact Predictions  
   -[ ] API for Generating Market Reports  

---

## **📌 Step 4: Frontend Development (React Dashboard)**
Once the backend is done, we build an **interactive UI**.

🔹 **Key Features:**
   -[ ] Market Dashboard (Live Stock Data + AI Predictions)  
   -[ ] Macroeconomic Dashboard (Interest Rates, GDP, Inflation)  
   -[ ] Sentiment Analysis Reports (Live Social Sentiment Trends)  
   -[ ] AI-Powered Stock Price Forecasting  

---

## **📌 Step 5: Deployment (Production-Ready)**
Finally, we will **deploy the project**.

-[ ] **Backend:** AWS (EC2, RDS for PostgreSQL), Docker, Kubernetes  
-[ ] **Frontend:** Vercel (for React), CloudFront  
-[ ] **Model Serving:** AWS Lambda or FastAPI with GPU on Google Cloud  
-[ ] **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions + Docker
